Question: "When should accessor methods are used?"
Answer: Generally, accessor methods shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary. These methods expose information about how a class is implemented and in consequence make your code harder to maintain. 

Question: "If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?"
Answer: You are not allowed to do this in JAVA. The reason being that these two methods have the same footprint (In this case, both of these methods have the name "DigitalVideoDisc" and take one String as parameters). This directly violates overloading method principle, causing confusion the compiling process.
